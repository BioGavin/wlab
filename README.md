***Additional note: This repository has been reorganized and the original wlabkit repository is currently a subproject in this repository.***

## Content

- [wlabkit](./wlabkit): the first project I created, but due to the lack of experience and difficulties in maintaining it at a later stage, it has now been left in this repository as a historical archive project.
- [astool](https://github.com/BioGavin/astool): scripts for processing antiSMASH-related files
- [seqtool](./seqtool): scripts for processing sequences.
